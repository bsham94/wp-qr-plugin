# Wordpress QR Code Plugin
Simple Wordpress plugin for protecting pages with QR Codes.

### How it works
Set a post to user_profile
Add shortcode to the post with category user_profile
Your post should now be protected. Only the author of the page and admins can view the post without scanning the corresponding QR Code. 
Everyone else gets redirected to the home url of the Wordpress site.
